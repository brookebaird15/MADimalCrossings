This is an unoffical ACNH Villager Compendium! An app that is dedicated to the user to be able to go hunting for villagers in Animal Crossing New Horizons™.
Users can keep track of who the villagers they’ve seen and who they’re on the hunt to find! Users would also be able to add any potential villagers to a wishlist that they may want for their island. 

Some of the other features of this app include:
* A Bingo game to give the user an experience to do while they're island exploring for villagers 
* A KK Slider music player and allows to be added to a collection
* A news tab to keep up-to-date with Nintendo-related news

### Built With
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/)
