# MAD405 Final Project

The main purpose of the app would be for the end user to be able to go hunting for villagers in Animal Crossing New Horizons™. The user could keep track of who the villagers they’ve seen and who they’re wanting to find. The user would also be able to add any potential villagers to a wishlist that they may want for their island. This would require the extensive use of an API known as ACNH API. 

Two smaller features planned in the app would be the ability for the user to hunt down locations of Amiibos and/or Amiibo cards related to Animal Crossing. The other feature would be an RSS feed of Animal Crossing’s official Twitter and Nintendo’s News and Events, for the possibility of Nintendo Direct being announced. 

Intents

The intents that we plan on using throughout our app are as follows:

An official link to the Animal Crossing twitter via a social media intent
A calendar event for the user to track game releases, Nintendo directs, etc.
A map intent used to show to the user where to buy product 
A music player so the user can listen to different K.K Slider tracks
